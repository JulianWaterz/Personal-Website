			Hi, My name is <b>Squirrelly.&#174;</b> I live in the forest and <i>rummage</i> around looking for things.
			I can tell you what type of <u>fruit</u> each tree bears.
			<mark>I love trees!</mark> Sometimes I <em>chase</em> my friends up and tree, then down the tree.
			Sometimes we <em>jump</em> from tree to tree and pretend we are birds.
			<em>HEHE,</em> we have lots of fun in the forest! <b>Thanks for visiting my website.</b>
