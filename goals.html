	Program Purpose: My Personal Website For Experimental Reasons I Will Try To Use CSS But Not JS Because I'm Not Yet Familiar With It, So This Web page Is Rough Around The Edges
	
	--------------------------------------------------
	Here Is My Goals Page, It Tells My Goals For The Future??
	It Also Now Shows My Schedule And Resume At The Bottom Of The Page.
	A Major Edit, Most Of This Stuff Was From A Long Time Ago.

			<p>One Of My Main Goals Is To Just Get Past School.</p>
			<p>Also My Main Focus When I Graduate Is Wanting To Try And Become Some Kind Of Computer Hardware IT..</p>
			<p>HTML 5 Was Not What I Was Expecting To Do But It's A Start For Sure.</p>
